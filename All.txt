✅ Updated Competency 1 — Sheet: Impact

Competency	Examples	Results

I work with my manager or team to identify and prioritize tasks that add the most value for the customer.	I worked on optimizing script logic and introduced a common approach that reduced the effort required across multiple counties.	Helped cut down estimation effort by 90%, saved team time, and improved delivery speed across 3000+ automation scripts.

✅ Sheet: Impact

Competency	Examples	Results

I work with my manager to prioritize tasks and deliver results for customers.	I prioritized an AI-based automation task after discussion with my manager, balancing it alongside sprint work.	Delivered the solution without delays and reduced manual efforts for the team.
I understand and participate in core team processes.	I regularly contribute in sprint planning, bug triage, and retrospectives by reviewing tasks and suggesting improvements.	Helped the team plan better and reduced estimation errors and spillovers.
I deliver high-quality work with guidance from my manager.	I completed a complex bug fix in our MBST tool, ensuring the scroll data issue didn’t affect output quality.	Improved data accuracy and received appreciation for solving a long-standing issue.
I ask important unasked questions.	I often ask basic but overlooked questions during retros and discussions, especially around edge cases.	This has helped catch bugs early and improve team understanding and solution quality.

✅ Sheet: Core

Competency	Examples	Results

I follow through on my commitments.	I took ownership of an AI-based feature and finished it on time, without any delays or reassignments.	Built strong trust with my manager and team for being dependable and consistent.
I’m reliable and deliver consistent work.	Delivered multiple user stories end-to-end without spillovers and kept my sprint commitments.	Helped the team meet sprint goals and ensured steady delivery quality.
I collaborate across the development lifecycle.	I’ve worked on design, testing, review, and deployment activities for our scripts and UI project.	Ensured smooth delivery with minimal post-release issues or rework.
I ask questions and accept feedback.	I ask questions in meetings and feedback sessions to improve my understanding of the code and tasks.	Received better clarity and learned faster, which helped improve my code.
I ask for help when needed.	When stuck with a scrollbar capture issue, I reached out to my tech lead for support and solved it.	Fixed the issue quickly and improved my approach for future problems.
I improve team processes.	I suggested code patterns to reuse logic and improve maintainability across scripts.	This reduced redundancy and made future changes faster and easier.
I share project info and trade-offs.	I informed my team about the time-cost of integrating AI in parsing logic during planning.	Helped make better prioritization decisions and align with sprint goals.
I respect team perspectives.	During code reviews, I listen and accept feedback from peers even when ideas differ from mine.	Helped improve the solution and strengthened team collaboration.
I support operations and solve issues.	Investigated and resolved layout change issues in websites affecting data scraping.	Reduced recurring errors and improved stability of our automation scripts.

✅ Sheet: Craft

Competency	Examples	Results

I write clear and understandable code.	I refactored old scripts by improving structure, naming, and adding inline comments.	Made it easier for team members to understand and update the codebase.
I understand code I didn’t write.	I worked on a large codebase built by others and added new logic for trust name parsing.	Successfully made changes without breaking existing features.
I deliver fast and good-quality work.	Balanced sprint work and an AI module task by prioritizing and managing my time well.	Delivered both tasks on time while maintaining good quality.
I do code reviews and ask questions.	I actively take part in reviews and ask questions around logic, structure, and improvements.	This helps me learn and also contributes to better code from others.
My code is clean, tested, and reliable.	I fixed a tricky bug related to internal scrollbars and added proper test cases for it.	Prevented future bugs and improved data extraction reliability.
I explain my solutions clearly.	I proposed and explained my OpenAI-based name extraction logic to the team with examples.	Team approved the solution and implementation was smooth.
I can deploy working software.	I have deployed Angular project updates and script changes after testing and validations.	Ensured successful deployment without rollback or production issues.
